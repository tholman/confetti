### React Confetti

A react component to show a neat css animated confetti effect I've used around 50 times over the last 10 years. Componentized for easy use, variablility and a few extra bells and whistles.

Credit where credit is due, after a lot of digging I believe [this]() is the original? Although perhaps it too had some prior art.

#### Installation

```bash
tk
```
